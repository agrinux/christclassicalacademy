          Christ Classical Academy envisions a fully accredited K-12 institution where students are formed into wise, articulate, and faithful leaders who embody the truth of God's Word. Through rich literature, the natural sciences, and the art of thoughtful discourse, we strive to establish a school that cultivates generations of Christ-confessing scholars who think critically, communicate eloquently, and serve faithfully in their various vocations.
