Dr. Miller brings over 20 years of experience in classical education and holds a doctorate in Educational Leadership from Hillsdale College. Before joining Christ Classical Academy, he served as Academic Dean at a classical Lutheran school in St. Louis and taught courses in rhetoric and Western Civilization.

A lifelong Lutheran, Dr. Miller is passionate about integrating faith and learning, helping students see all subjects through the lens of Scripture. He believes that education is not merely about information but formationâ€”shaping students' affections to love what is true, good, and beautiful.

Dr. Miller and his wife, Catherine, have four children, all of whom attend Christ Classical Academy. In his free time, he enjoys reading classic literature, playing chess, and hiking with his family.
