# Summer Reading List Released

Our faculty has compiled grade-specific summer reading lists to keep students engaged with great literature during the summer break.

Reading great books is an essential part of a classical education, and summer provides an excellent opportunity for students to enjoy literature at a more relaxed pace. Each list includes a mix of classics and quality contemporary works appropriate for each age level.

## Reading Lists by Grade

### Grammar Stage (K-5)
Each list includes 5-7 books with a mix of read-aloud titles for parents and independent reading options for students.

### Logic Stage (6-8)
Each list includes 3-4 required books and 2-3 choice books from a curated selection.

### Rhetoric Stage (9-12)
Each list includes 2-3 required books and a choice of 1-2 additional books from a curated selection.

All students will complete a simple reading response for each book, which will be due during the first week of school. These responses are designed to encourage thoughtful engagement with the text rather than mere completion.

Reading lists are available on our website or can be picked up from the school office. Local bookstores Claflin Books and Manhattan Public Library will have copies of all titles available.

Happy reading!
