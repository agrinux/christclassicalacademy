# New Latin Program Launches

Christ Classical Academy is pleased to announce the launch of our enhanced Latin program for all grade levels, beginning this fall semester.

## Why Latin?

Latin provides numerous benefits to students:

- Strengthens English vocabulary (over 60% of English words have Latin roots)
- Develops logical thinking and analytical skills
- Improves understanding of grammar and language structure
- Provides access to classical texts in their original language
- Lays the foundation for learning other Romance languages

## Program Structure

Our Latin program follows a carefully sequenced curriculum:

- **Grammar Stage (K-5):** Introduction to Latin vocabulary, simple phrases, songs, and chants
- **Logic Stage (6-8):** Formal Latin grammar, translation of adapted classical texts
- **Rhetoric Stage (9-12):** Advanced Latin grammar, translation of original classical texts

We are thrilled to welcome Mrs. Elizabeth Carter as our new Latin instructor. Mrs. Carter holds a Master's degree in Classics from the University of Kansas and has over 10 years of experience teaching Latin at the elementary and secondary levels.
