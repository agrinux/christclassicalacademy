## Our Story

Christ Classical Academy was founded by a group of Lutheran families and educators who recognized the need for a school that combines academic excellence with faithful Christian teaching in the Manhattan area.

Inspired by the classical education model that has formed scholars for centuries, our school is built on the conviction that truth, goodness, and beauty are objective realities that reflect the nature of God and can be known by human beings.

We are committed to partnering with parents to provide an education that nurtures the whole child—mind, body, and spirit—preparing them not just for college or career, but for a life of wisdom and virtue.

## Classical Lutheran Education Defined

Classical Lutheran education is a time-tested approach to learning with a rich history dating back to the Reformation. Martin Luther and his colleague Philip Melanchthon were strong advocates for educational reform, and their work helped to shape what we now call classical Lutheran education.

Classical Lutheran education:

- **Teaches all subjects as parts of an integrated whole with the Scriptures at the center**
- **Follows the classical model of the Trivium (Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric stages)**
- **Cultivates wisdom and virtue through immersion in the liberal arts and sciences**
- **Recognizes that all knowledge is unified in Christ, in whom "are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge" (Colossians 2:3)**
- **Prepares students to serve faithfully in their various vocations**

## Why Classical Lutheran Education?

In an age of educational experimentation and rapidly changing pedagogical theories, classical Lutheran education offers a proven, time-tested approach to forming young people intellectually, spiritually, and morally.

Classical Lutheran education:

- **Equips students with the tools of learning**, enabling them to become lifelong learners
- **Immerses students in the great conversation** of Western civilization
- **Cultivates wisdom and virtue** rather than merely imparting information
- **Prepares students for thoughtful service** in church and society
- **Integrates faith and learning** rather than compartmentalizing them
- **Honors the vocation of childhood** rather than treating children as mini-adults

## What Makes Us Distinct

- **Classical Methodology:** Following the time-tested Trivium of Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric stages.
- **Lutheran Doctrine:** Grounded in the historic Lutheran confession of faith.
- **Integrated Curriculum:** All subjects taught as an integrated whole with Christ at the center.

## Statement of Faith

Christ Classical Academy adheres to the historic Lutheran confessions, particularly as expressed in the Book of Concord. We believe:

- The Bible is the inspired and inerrant Word of God, the only infallible rule of faith and practice.
- In the Triune God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
- In the deity of Christ, His virgin birth, His sinless life, His miracles, His atoning death, His resurrection, His ascension, and His future return in power and glory.
- That salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.
- In the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ.
