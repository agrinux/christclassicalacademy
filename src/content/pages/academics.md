## Classical Lutheran Education

At Christ Classical Academy, we follow the classical model of education known as the Trivium, which consists of three stages that correspond to a child's natural development, all integrated with the Lutheran confession of faith.

Classical Lutheran education is a time-tested approach to learning with a rich history dating back to the Reformation. Martin Luther and his colleague Philip Melanchthon were strong advocates for educational reform, and their work helped to shape what we now call classical Lutheran education.

### The Trivium and Lutheran Faith

The Trivium consists of three stages—Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric—which align with the natural development of children. At Christ Classical Academy, we integrate these stages with Lutheran theology and practice:

### Grammar Stage (K-5)

In the Grammar Stage, children naturally absorb information and memorize easily. We capitalize on this by focusing on the fundamental facts and rules of each subject—the "grammar" of knowledge—while nurturing faith through catechesis.

**Key Features:**
- Phonics-based reading instruction
- Singapore Math
- Latin foundations
- Hands-on science exploration
- Scripture and catechism memorization
- Lutheran hymns and liturgy

**Sample Subjects:**
- Literature & Composition
- History & Geography
- Mathematics
- Natural Science
- Latin
- Lutheran Catechesis
- Music & Art

### Logic Stage (6-8)

In the Logic Stage, students begin to think more analytically and question the world around them. We teach them how to reason, analyze arguments, and think critically within the framework of Lutheran doctrine.

**Key Features:**
- Formal logic instruction
- Socratic discussions
- Advanced Latin
- Pre-algebra and algebra
- Lutheran systematic theology
- Church history

**Sample Subjects:**
- Classical Literature
- Medieval to Modern History
- Logic & Reasoning

- Lutheran Theology & Ethics

### Rhetoric Stage (9-12)

In the Rhetoric Stage, students learn to express themselves with clarity, eloquence, and persuasion, synthesizing their knowledge into original, thoughtful expression, all while deepening their understanding of Lutheran doctrine and practice.

**Key Features:**
- Classical rhetoric
- Great Books discussions
- Advanced mathematics
- Lutheran apologetics
- Senior thesis project
- Vocational discernment

**Sample Subjects:**
- Great Books & Rhetoric
- Western Civilization
- Advanced Mathematics
- Physics & Chemistry

## What Makes Classical Lutheran Education Distinct

Classical Lutheran education is distinct in several important ways:

### Christ-Centered

All subjects are taught in light of Christ and His Word. We recognize that all truth is God's truth, and we help students see connections between their faith and their studies.

### Emphasis on Liberal Arts

We focus on the traditional liberal arts—language, literature, history, mathematics, science, music, and art—which develop the whole person rather than simply training for a specific career.

### Integration of Subjects

Rather than teaching subjects in isolation, we help students see the connections between different fields of knowledge, recognizing that all knowledge is unified in Christ.

### Focus on Primary Sources

Students engage with original texts and primary sources rather than relying solely on textbooks, allowing them to encounter great ideas directly.

### Development of Wisdom and Virtue

Beyond mere knowledge acquisition, we aim to cultivate wisdom and virtue in our students, helping them become not just knowledgeable but good.

### Vocational Formation

We help students understand that all of life is a calling from God, preparing them to serve faithfully in whatever vocation God calls them to.
